This repository is part of my Data Technician Bootcamp learning journey and demonstrates practical Python skills developed through structured training and hands-on exercises.
The work focuses on **Python fundamentals**, **problem-solving**, **data handling**, and **introductory data analysis using Pandas and visualization tools**.

## 📌 Overview

- Core Python programming concepts
- Control flow (loops and conditional statements)
- Functions and problem-solving challenges
- Data manipulation with Pandas
- Introductory data visualization
- Practical coding exercises using Google Colab, Kaggle, HackerRank, and CodeChef

All notebooks and scripts in this repository reflect hands-on exercises and challenges completed as part of the course.
